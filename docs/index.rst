Deadlock WebUI: the web management console
==========================================

The WebUI is a web application that connects to the `Deadlock <https://deadlock.readthedocs.io/>`_ server to provide the following functions:

* access rules management
* point of access management
* system status monitoring
* access logs monitoring

The UI is self-documenting. Therefore only developer documentation is available here.
