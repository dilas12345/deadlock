Libraries and tools used
========================

Standing on the shoulders of giants, or "yay 1MB for hello world", or something.

We are using:

- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), naturally.
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) to obtain and avoid React's Flux architecture.
- [ES6 -- the next generation Javascript](http://es6-features.org/), and therefore also [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)+[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to make it work in the previous generation browsers. For details see [Building process](build).
- a bunch of other awesome libraries -- check out `package.json`.
